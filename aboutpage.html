			<h3 style="font-family: arial;"> Hyperautomation </h3>

			<p style="font-family: arial;">What is Hyper-Automation? According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> one of the top ten trends for technology in 2020 is
			<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2020/">Hyper-Automation</a> which in basic terms is incorporating many technologies to automate tasks. 
			Better defined, hyper-automation is the applying of advanced technology with many tools centered on 
			Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Internet of Things (IoT), Intelligent Business Management Software (IBMS), 
			and components of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with terms like Machine Learning (ML), Neural Networks (NN), 
			and Deep Learning (DL). While all these terms are great, lets dig into a few of the 'whys' of AI and hyper-automation.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family: arial;"> Hyperautomation deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML),
			to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyperautomation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also 
			refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyze, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.) </p>
			
			<h3 style="font-family: arial;">"Hyperautomation often results in the creation of a digital twin of the organization" </h3>
			
			<p style="font-family: arial;">As no single tool can replace humans, 
			hyperautomation today involves a combination of tools, including robotic process automation (RPA), intelligent business management 
			software (iBPMS) and AI, with a goal of increasingly AI-driven decision making. Although not the main goal, hyperautomation 
			often results in the creation of a digital twin of the organization (DTO), allowing organizations to visualize how functions, 
			processes and key performance indicators interact to drive value. The DTO then becomes an integral part of the hyperautomation 
			process, providing real-time, continuous intelligence about the organization and driving significant business opportunities. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family: arial;" style="text-align: left"> Multiexperience </h3>
			
			<p style="font-family: arial;"> Multiexperience replaces technology-literate people with people-literate technology. In this trend, the traditional
			idea of a computer evolves from a single point of interaction to include multisensory and multitouchpoint interfaces like
			wearables and advanced computer sensors. For example, Domino’s Pizza created an experience beyond app-based ordering that 
			includes autonomous vehicles, a pizza tracker and smart speaker communications. In the future, this trend will become 
			what’s called an ambient experience, but currently multiexperience focuses on immersive experiences that use augmented 
			reality (AR), virtual (VR), mixed reality, multichannel human-machine interfaces and sensing technologies. The combination 
			of these technologies can be used for a simple AR overlay or a fully immersive VR experience. </p>

			<h3 style="font-family: arial;"> Distributed Cloud </h3>
			<p style="font-family: arial;"> Distributed cloud refers to the distribution of public cloud services to locations outside the cloud provider’s 
			physical data centers, but which are still controlled by the provider. In distributed cloud, the cloud provider is 
			responsible for all aspects of cloud service architecture, delivery, operations, governance and updates. The evolution 
			from centralized public cloud to distributed public cloud ushers in a new era of cloud computing. Distributed cloud allows 
			data centers to be located anywhere. This solves both technical issues like latency and also regulatory challenges like 
			data sovereignty. It also offers the benefits of a public cloud service alongside the benefits of a private, local cloud. </p>
